# NetRisk

## ABOUT
This is a new, free and open source, risk management app created to be secure, and elegant to use.


## RELEASES

This project is under heavy development and right now should be consider on alpha stages. We hope to be able to create a beta release soon. Untill then we do not plan on creating an instalable version.


## SETUP

To be able to develop using the described tools you will need some requirements:

- To have .net 7 installed and visual studio or rider IDE (you can work with others but we recomend one of those 2) 
- Setup some .net secrets on some specific projects. Here basically you need to add a connection string on any project that needs to connect to the database (and NO this canÂ´t be done on the DAL project). To do so follow the .net secrets procedure below


### .NET Secrets procedure

To setup .net user secretes you can follow the steps bellow or search here for more info https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows

- First init the secret on the project root dir with the following command: dotnet user-secrets init
- Then add a new secret in our case we need a datasource so: dotnet user-secrets set "Database:ConnectionString" "server=X.X.X.X;uid=YYYY;pwd=JDHFI;database=simplerisk;ConvertZeroDateTime=True"
- Finally add the guiclient secret dotnet user-secrets set "Server:Url" "https://127.0.0.1:5443"


## BUILD

We use nuke build to prepare the artifacts of the .net projects. 

To use it you need to first install the nuke build tool on your machine with the following command: dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global

Then you can run the build with the following command: nuke build
